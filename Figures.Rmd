## 1. Outcomes of Model

These plots display the three outcomes of the Lotka-Volterra Competition model: endemic survival, coexistence, and invader success.

```{r Outcomes}
df.endemic <- alphaSim
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
