Currently, the probablistic model has been created but requires optimization and file organization needs to be completed for reduced runtime, decreased dependencies, and ease of model iteration. Graphical outputs in ggplot seem to align with predictions made in the deterministic model.

'plotsAndSuch.R' now displays both the deterministic and probabilistic models overlayed with each other for comparison. 'determModel.R' now holds the deterministic model which has been replaced with the same code as the probabilistic model without the calls to rpois. This should allow for easier plotting in ggplot eliminates a package use (deSolve).
